Feature: Editing an application
	As a user, I want to edit an application   

        Background:
            Given user is at developer perspective
              And user has selected namespace "aut-topology-editing-app-node"


        @regression, @smoke
        Scenario: Editing a workload : T-06-TC14, T-06-TC15
            Given user has created workload "<workload_name>"  with resource type "<resource_type>"
              And user is at the Topolgy page
             When user right clicks on the node "<workload_name>" to open context menu
              And user selects option "Edit <workload_name>" from context menu
              And user can see Edit form
              And user verifies that name of the node and route option is not editable
              And user verifies that Application grouping, git url, builder image version and advanced option can be edited
              And user edits Application name as "nodejs-ex-git-app-1"
              And user clicks on save
             Then user can see the change of node to the new Application "nodejs-ex-git-app-1"

        Examples:
                  | resource_type     | workload_name   |
                  | deployment        | nodejs-ex-git   |
                  | deployment config | dancer-ex-git-1 |
