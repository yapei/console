Feature: Display task runs page
              As a developer, I would like to navigate from a PipelineRun to the related TaskRuns and their associated pods so that I can debug my pipelines by looking at the volumes, secrets, etc that are made available to the taskruns and pods.

        Background:
            Given user has created or selected namespace "aut-pipelines"
              And user is at pipelines page

            Given pipeline run is displayed for "pipeline-tasks-one" with resource
             When user clicks on pipeline "pipeline-tasks-one"
              And user clicks on Pipeline Runs tab
              And user clicks on a Pipeline Run
              And user clicks on Task Runs tab
             Then user can see different task runs based on number of tasks executed in pipeline
              And user can see Name, Task, Pod, Status and Started columns

              And user clicks on Task Runs tab
              And user clicks on a Succeeded task run

        Scenario Outline: Task Runs Details page with Workspaces
            Given pipeline "<pipeline_name>" is created with "<workspace_name>" workspace
             And pipeline "<pipeline_name>" is executed with workspace type "<workspace_type>"
             And user is at Task Runs tab of pipeline run with all kind of Workspaces
             When user clicks on a task run associated with "<workspace_name>" "<resource>" Resources
             Then user is redirected to Task Run Details tab
              And user will see "<workspace_type>" label with "<workspace_name>" Workspace "shared-task-storage" mentioned in the "<resource>" Resources section of Task Run Details page

        Examples:
                  | pipeline_name | workspace_type        | workspace_name      | resource            |
                  | pipe-wp-t1    | PersistentVolumeClaim | PVC                 | Workspace           |
                  | pipe-wp-t2    | Config Map            | Config Map          | Workspace           |
                  | pipe-wp-t3    | Secret                | Secret              | Workspace           |
                  | pipe-wp-t4    | Empty Directory       | Empty Directory     | Workspace           |
                  | pipe-wp-t5    | VolumeClaimTemplate   | VolumeClaimTemplate | VolumeClaimTemplate |


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario: Task Run results on Task Run details page for passed task run
            Given pipeline run with passed task run is displayed for "pipeline-tasks-one"
              And user is on Task Run details page of passed task run
             When user scrolls to the Task Run results section
             Then user can see Name and Value column under Task Run results


        @regression @to-do
        Scenario: Task Run results on Task Run details page for failed task run
            Given pipeline run with failed task run is displayed for "pipeline-tasks-one"
            # user can use yaml content "sum-and-multiply-pipeline/sum-and-multiply-pipeline.yaml"
              And user is on Task Run details page of failed task run
             When user scrolls to the Task Run results section
             Then user can see message "No Task Run results available due to failure."
