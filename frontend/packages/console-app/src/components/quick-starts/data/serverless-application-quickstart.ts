    introduction: `### OpenShift Serverless is flexible. With Serverless, you get:

**Scalability**
Your apps scale automatically, increasing containers to handle peak loads and rolling them back at lulls.

**Interoperability**
Serverless gives you access to a rich ecosystem of built-in and third-party event sources, like Kafka, GitHub, and other SaaS solutions.

**Iteration**
Deploying new versions of apps is simple with Serverless. Perform canary, A/B, and blue-green testing with confidence. By using app revisions, you can roll things back, or split traffic between revisions, as needed.

This guided tour shows you how to create a Serverless app that realizes these benefits.

In this tour, you perform five tasks:
1. Create a Serverless application
2. Demo scalability
3. Wire an event source to your Knative Service
4. Force a new revision & set traffic distribution
5. Delete your application`,

        description: `### Follow these steps to create an Serverless application:
1. Using the perspective switcher at the top of the navigation, go to **</> Developer**.
2. Using the project dropdown, select the project you would like to create the demo application in. You can also create a new one if you’d like.
3. Once there, go to the **+Add** page in the navigation.
3. Click **From Git** to create an application.
4. In the field labeled **Git Repo URL**, copy and paste [https://github.com/sclorg/django-ex.git](https://github.com/sclorg/django-ex.git).
5. In the field labeled Application Name, add the name Sample Serverless App.
6. Under **Resources**, select **Knative Service**.
7. Scroll down and click **Create**.
The Topology view will load with your new Serverless application. The application is represented by the light grey area with the white border. The Knative Service is the darker grey area with the dotted border. The pod donut in the middle represents the revision.`,

3. Wait for the Pod Count to scale down to 0 pods. This may take a few minutes.
4. Click the route URL icon in the top right corner of the Knative Service. The application will open in a new tab.
5. Close the new browser tab and go back to the Topology view.
