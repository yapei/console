    introduction: `The Red Hat® OpenShift® Serverless provides an enterprise-grade serverless platform. Based on the open source Knative project, it provides a solution for efficient application development supporting dynamic scale and providing a reliable and secure event-driven mechanism to connect on-cluster and off-cluster event producers, bringing portability and consistency across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
    Run anywhereUse Kubernetes and OpenShift to build, scale, and manage serverless applications in any cloud, on-premise, or hybrid environment.
    Integrate with legacyBuild modern, serverless applications and support legacy apps by using event sources. Manage all of your applications in one place: Red Hat OpenShift.
    Focus on businessKnative allows app teams to focus on building products. Knative installs on OpenShift using Operators, simplifying installation and automating updates and management.
    Operations friendlyKnative uses Kubernetes to achieve greater consistency and more granular scalability across applications and teams.`,
